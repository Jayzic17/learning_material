3 installation methods:
	* installer-provisioned: the openshift installer provisions everything for you
		* supports aws, azure, gcp, openstack, and RHEV
	* user-provisioned: the user/customer provisions everything; little harder but more granular
		* supports aws, azure, gcp, vmware, ibm z, ibm power, and bare metal
	* laptop/desktop-provisioned:
		* uses CodeReady Containers to provision everything on your local computer using a VM
CodeReady Containers: runs in a single VM; gives you a minimal OpenShift 4 Cluster on your local computer
	* easy setup and configuration
	* it is ephermeral, meaning it doesn't last forever. Wouldn't be good for a PROD environment. Good for learning
3 hardware requirements for running CodeReady Containers:
	* vCPUs: need 4 virtual CPUs
	* Memory: need 9 GB of free memory
	* Storage Space: need 35 GB of free storage
OS requirements for CodeReady Containers:
	* Windows:
		* windows 10 and up
	* macOS:
		* Sierra or newer
	* Linux (all with NetworkManager installed):
		* Supported:
			* RHEL/CentOS 7.5 or newer
			* Fedora -2 latest release
		* Unsupported:
			* Ubuntu 18.04 or newer
			* Debian 10 or newer
.openshift_install.log file contains info about the url where your CodeReady Cluster was deployed, a username, and password when you first create it
HTPasswd: one of the Identity Providers available to you with OpenShift that you can set up
Default Cluster Roles:
	* admin: can view and modify any Resource in the Project except for Quota
	* basic-user: can get basic information about Projects and Users
	* clsuter-admin: Super-user with any action for any Project on any Resource, including Quota
	* cluster-status: can get basic Cluster status information
	* edit: can modify most objects in a Project, but does not have the power to view or modify Roels or Bindings
	* self-provisioner: can create their own Projects
	* view: can see most objects in a Project; can't view Roles or Bindings
Default Virtual Groups:
	* system:authenticated
	* system:authenticated:oauth
	* system:unauthenticated
Types of Secrets:
	* kubernetes.io/service-account-token
	* kubernetes.io/basic-auth
	* kubernetes.io/ssh-auth
	* kubernetes.io/tls
	* Opaque: means no authentication or validation
Self-Signed Certificate: a certificate that is not signed by a Certificate Authority (CA) it's signed by you
OpenShift does not support password-protected (passphrase) certificates
4 types of Quota Scopes:
	* Terminating
	* Non-Terminating
	* Best Effort
	* Not Best Effort
Service Account: an account that exists in a Project which allows for accessing the API without having to share a regular user's credentials
Cluster Network Operator: an OpenShift Operator that deploys and manages the Cluster network components on a Cluster
Security Context Constraints: lets you control what actions and access the Pods in your Container have
MachineSets: the physical hardware that runs in the background, so if Nodes run Pods, then machines refer to the physical hardware of the Nodes
