Task: An operation that the Container runs; scaling the desired number of Tasks for a Container up/down is how you manage traffic (how many operations can be performed at-a-time) for the Container
Container: a specific service that is built using a Docker Image
Pod: smallest possible kubernetes deployment; contains multiple Docker Containers
Node: a physical machine
Cluster: a group of Nodes
Control Plane: the Master Node that manages the Cluster
	* has the following services installed for managing the Cluster:
		* kube-apiserver: an API server that handles all internal/external API calls for interacting with / managing the Cluster
		* ETCD: key/value DB that contains info used to manage the Cluster
			* cotains the current state of any and all resources defined in the cluster
		* controller-manager: the controllers used to run the Cluster
		* kube-scheduler: scheduler used for distributing work/Containers across multiple Nodes
Worker Node: the rest of the Nodes that aren't the Master Node / Control Plane
	* has the following services installed for managing the Node:
		* Kublet: agent run on each Node used to communicate back to the Cluster
		* Kube-proxy: networking component used to allow communication btwn other Worker Nodes and their Containers
		* Container runtime: used to run Containers
Replicaset: a set of Pods
Deployment: a set of Pods, except it gives you higher-level control and options on actual rollout and deployment strategy
Service: is what allows for Pods to talk to each other and for users to talk to Pods
	* ClusterIP: allows Pods to talk privatly with each other within the Cluster and NOT outside to users
	* NodePort: allows users to talk with a Pod within the Cluster
	* LoadBalancer
Namespace: lets you organize different resources in the same cluster based on their Namespace
	* general usecases:
		* seperate resources based on teams
		* using Namespaces as environments
		* using it for blue/green deployments
		* you can limit usage quotas (cpu/mem/etc.) per Namespace
	* the other option would just have multiple clusters which is fine if you have multiple cloud accounts
