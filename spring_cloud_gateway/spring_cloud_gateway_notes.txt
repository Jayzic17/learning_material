		* collection of Predicates
		* collection of Filters
Predicates: the conditions that match an API call to a specific Route
	* lets you match on anything from the HTTP request
Filter: lets you pre-process or post-process API calls
Gateway Client (the client for the Gateway) -> Gateway Handler(handles the Predicates) -> Gateway Web Handler(handles the Filters) -> Service
Global Filters: Filters that apply globally to all routes
